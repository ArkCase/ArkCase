  sessionCookiePathUsesTrailingSlash: set to false, so the session cookie path does not end with /.  During SSO
  implementation, the trailing slash caused some problems:
    1. Logged in user accesses 'http://server/arkcase' (no trailing slash), they will be logged out.  That is
       bad - they should stay logged in.
    2. Before login, user opens 'http://server/arkcase' (no trailing slash), they get the login page.  In SSO
       environments, after login they are redirected to '/arkcase' (no trailing slash) and immediately logged back
       out.  That's bad!  They should be logged in.

  Setting this value to false resolves both these issues, and still seems to work OK in non-SSO environments.
