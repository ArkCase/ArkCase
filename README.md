# ArkCase
====

ArkCase aims to be the leading open source case management and IT modernization platform. After supporting numerous case management and IT modernization initiatives, the team at Armedia developed a framework to accelerate these initiatives and to reduce the cost of implementation.  That framework matured and is the basis for ArkCase.  We have and will continue to invest in making ArkCase a premier platform for IT modernization.  As a thank you to our customers who embarked on this journey with us and a thank you to all the software engineers that have contributed open source technologies to advance this industry, ArkCase is now open source!
